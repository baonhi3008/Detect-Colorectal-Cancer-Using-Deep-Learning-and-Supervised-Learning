# Detect-Colorectal-Cancer-Using-Deep-Learning-and-Supervised-Learning

# I. Problem statement <a class="anchor" id="problemstatement"></a>

There were an estimated 18.1 million cancer cases around the world in 2020 [1]. With this growing global burden, prevention of cancer is one of the most significant public health challenges of the 21st century. Colorectal cancer, also known as colon cancer, is one of the top three most common types of cancer worldwide.

Colorectal cancer is a condition in which cells in the colon or rectum proliferate uncontrollably. The colon is also known as the large intestine or large bowel and the rectum is the passageway between the colon and the anus.

In this assignment, a machine learning model must be implemented to aid in the detection of cancerous cells and the differentiation of cell types in colon cancer. There are two major tasks that need to be delivered:

- **_Task 1: Cancerous Classification_**
- **_Task 2: Cell Types Classification_**

Supervised Machine Learning methods such as XGBoost, LightGBM, and Convolutional Neural Network methods such as Resnet50, AlexNet, and others will be thoroughly discussed in order to determine which best serves the aforementioned classification problems.

# My main work in the project is re-built 5 different CNN architectures to detect cancerous types and also classify cell types
